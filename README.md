# Note-Taker

This application is for users that need to keep track of a lot of information as it can be really easy to forget something when you have multiple responsibilities to attend to. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

This application will allow users to:

- create and save notes.
- view previously saved notes.
- delete previously saved notes.
